# build-gutenberg-dataset
Contains a quick duct tape approach for 
1. Download the ENTIRE RAW TXT ebooks from gutenberg. (10GB+)
2. Process it  a bit using basic NIX commands remove non ASCII characters etc.
3. Build a dataset and upload it to Huggingface HUB

   NOTE: THE ENTIRE LIBRARY IS MASSIVE SO PLAN DISK SPACE ACCORDINGLY.
